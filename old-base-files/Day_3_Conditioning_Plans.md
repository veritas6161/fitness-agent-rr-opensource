🔥 Day 3 — Heavy Conditioning / HIIT + Jumps

**Target:** No strict exercise limit (conditioning/EMOM workouts can exceed 6–8) | **HR Peak:** 165–180 | **Session Length:** 50–55 min | **Strain Target:** 12–14

This day focuses on explosive power, metabolic conditioning, and athleticism. Designed to spike HR into Z4–5 while building capacity for Hyrox/Spartan/Tactical Fitness events.

**Note:** Unlike strength days (Day 4, 5, 6) which have a 6–9 exercise limit, conditioning and EMOM workouts can include more exercises as needed. This allows for more variety in explosive work, conditioning circuits, and EMOM formats.

🛡️ Guardrails

**Must Follow:**
1. **Complete each block in one location** before moving to next block
2. **Maintain HR >135** during transitions — keep rest periods tight (45–60 sec)
3. **Exercise volume:** No strict limit for conditioning/EMOM workouts — can include more exercises than strength days (which have 6–9 limit)
4. **Strain target:** 12–14 (sustainable, not CNS-overloading)
5. **Burpee form:** Focus on proper mechanics to avoid lower back irritation
6. **Explosive work first:** Block A should spike HR, Block B sustains it

**Exercise Substitutions:**
• If sled unavailable → Add another rower sprint or assault bike set
• If rope unavailable → Substitute with wall balls (Floor 3) or high-intensity bodyweight circuit
• If floor space limited → Choose Version A (mostly Floor 3) or Version C (less equipment-dependent)

**Volume Management:**
• Feeling great? Add 1 optional exercise in Block B or Block C
• CNS fatigued? Drop 1 exercise, keep intensity high
• Sleep <6h20m? Use Version A (shorter) or drop 1 optional exercise

**Wrist Safety:**
• No pushups in burpee variation — use "burpee without pushup"
• If any wrist irritation, substitute explosive work with leg-dominant movements

💡 Pro Tips

**Execution:**
1. **Warm-up intensity:** Keep it light — HR 120–140. Save energy for working sets
2. **Block A pacing:** These should feel explosive but controlled — not max effort (save that for Block B)
3. **Block B mindset:** All-out efforts — HR should hit 165–180. Rest periods are your recovery
4. **Block C quality:** Core work is about control and stability, not intensity — maintain form

**Progression:**
1. **Week 1–2:** Focus on form and establishing baseline reps/times
2. **Week 3–4:** Increase reps by 2–4 per exercise OR reduce rest by 5–10 sec
3. **Week 5–6:** Add 1 more set to 1 exercise OR add optional exercise if energy allows
4. **PR tracking:** Track best time on 30s rower sprint, best distance on sled push

**HR Monitoring:**
• Aim for 1–2 HR spikes into Z5 (165–180) per session
• If HR not hitting targets → reduce rest periods by 5–10 sec
• If HR too high too early → add 10–15 sec rest between blocks

**Recovery Cues:**
• If Whoop strain >14 → Next Day 3, use Version A (shorter) or drop 1 optional exercise
• If lower back tight after burpees → Use "burpee without pushup" and focus on landing mechanics
• If CNS fatigued → Finish with 2 core exercises max, skip optional

**Athletic Focus:**
• Think "movement quality" not just "work done"
• Land softly on all jumps — protect joints, build durability
• Drive phase emphasis on rower/bike — full extension, powerful
