📊 Reza's Fitness Evaluation Framework

This framework provides weekly and monthly evaluation systems to track both agent performance (workout quality, adherence to preferences) and personal performance (execution, goal progress, recovery).

⸻

🎯 Evaluation Philosophy

**Weekly Focus:** Process metrics, adherence, performance, recovery
**Monthly Focus:** Outcome metrics, body composition, strength PRs, goal progress

**Dual Tracking:**
• **Agent Performance:** How well workouts align with preferences, structure, constraints
• **Personal Performance:** How well you execute, recover, progress toward goals

**Action-Oriented:** Each eval should generate insights and action items for the following week/month

⸻

📅 WEEKLY EVALUATION (Primary)

**Frequency:** Every Sunday (end of week)
**Time Required:** 10–15 min
**Purpose:** Track process, adherence, immediate performance

⸻
