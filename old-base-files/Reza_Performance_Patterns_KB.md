🧠 Reza Fitness KB — Preferences, Strengths, Weaknesses & Performance Patterns

This KB defines actual preferences, strengths, weaknesses, and performance patterns derived from 6 months of workout data, Whoop strain data, recovery patterns, and real-time feedback. Use this to design optimal sessions.

⸻

🔥 1. What You Genuinely Get Excited About

**You light up when a workout includes:**

• **Heavy compounds with visible progression**
  - Hitting PR squats at 155 lbs, RDL increases, chest press progression

• **Sessions that create a "pump"**
  - Especially biceps, back, and push days

• **Explosive work**
  - Jumping patterns, skater hops, box jumps, burpees, power drive movements

• **Conditioning with a challenge arc**
  - HIIT blocks, HYROX-style sled pushes, EMOMs, and anything where HR spikes into Z4–5

• **Clear structure:** Warm-up → Block A (heavy) → Block B (pump/accessories) → Finisher

• **Lateral / ski-prep training**
  - You enjoy feeling "athletic," not just "gym strong"

• **Soreness in the right places**
  - Glutes, quads, upper back, abs = "good soreness"

• **Efficient 35–45 min sessions with 1–2 intensity spikes**

**Your excitement dips when:**

• The workout is too generic, too light, or feels like filler
• Movements irritate your wrist (pushups, front rack) or lower back (poor burpee form)
• You feel like you didn't "accomplish enough" in the session

⸻

🧬 2. Your Strengths (Physiological + Psychological)

**A. Strength Adaptation**
• Lower body strength is trending upward fast
• Your squat PR (155 lbs) is extremely aligned with your current lean mass (120.5 lbs)
• You respond well to posterior chain work — RDLs, pulls, glutes

**B. Cardio Engine**
• Your Zone 2 blocks are dominant and efficient (long incline walks, 50-min sustained cardio)
• You can hit 173–180 HR peaks without dropping off — strong anaerobic resilience

**C. Recovery Intelligence**
• You actually listen to your body: soreness, tightness, CNS fatigue, HRV
• You pivot intelligently (e.g., switching blocks, rearranging workouts, active recovery)

**D. Psychological Strength**

You have three elite traits most people don't:

1. **Metacognition + self-awareness** → you reflect on strain, execution, form, and energy
2. **Progress-driven mindset** → you care about reps, weights, tempo, and feeling
3. **Dual-mode discipline:**
   - Warrior weekdays
   - Controlled-flex weekends

This consistency drives your -1 to -1.2% bodyfat every 8–10 weeks trend.

⸻

🩻 3. Your Weaknesses & Bottlenecks (in performance terms)

*None of these are character flaws — they are bottlenecks the program must design around.*

**A. CNS Recovery Lags Behind Your Work Rate**
• Many workouts hit 13–16 Whoop strain back-to-back
• Sleep often sits around 6h–6h30m, which caps adaptation
• You occasionally lose energy for work after 14+ strain days

**B. Right Wrist Limitation**
• Limits front-rack positions, push-ups, dips, and some barbell pressing
• Requires DB-neutral or cable substitutions

**C. Lower Back Gets Irritated With Bad Burpee Form**
• Not injured — but the tightness after burpees was consistent with mechanics + fatigue

**D. Volume Creep**
• You often add 1–2 extra exercises because you're feeling good → leads to fatigue later

**E. Need for a True Parasympathetic Reset**
• Your body responds extremely well when you take:
  - 1 low-intensity day
  - Sauna + stretch
  - High sleep night
• ...but you rarely do it

⸻

🏋️ 4. Your Workout Preferences (Precise + Actionable)

**Warm-Up Preferences**
• Foam rolling + mobility + 3–5 min rowing/ski erg
• Warm-up sets matter more to you than long warmups

**Main Block Preferences**
• Heavy squats, deadlifts, RDLs, chest press, lat pulldowns, bicep curls
• Prefer 2–3 heavy sets at RPE 7–8 → then higher-rep accessory

**Accessory Block Preferences**

**You LOVE:**
• Face pulls
• Curls
• DB shoulder press
• Renegade rows
• Machine chest fly
• Leg press
• Lunges / split squats
• Core finishers: deadbugs, planks, knee tucks

**You dislike:**
• Dips (wrist)
• Push-ups (wrist)
• HIIT-only workouts with no lifting
• Random filler exercises

**Cardio Preferences**
• Cardio after lifting, never before
• Zone 2 on incline treadmill is your go-to
• Condition days = explosive + structured

⸻

📈 5. Performance Patterns (From Your Logs)

**Where You Consistently Excel**
• Upper body pump sessions → you leave energized, not drained
• Heavy lower body days → PRs feel motivating
• Hybrid days (strength + HIIT) → your HR zones distribute beautifully:
  - Z2 37%
  - Z3 19%
  - Z4 16%
  - Z5 2%
• Long cardio after travel → resets your system

**Where Your Performance Dips**
• When sleep < 6h20m
• When stacking >2 high-strain days (14+ strain)
• When dehydration + caffeine hit the GI system
• When you rush transitions (mind-muscle connection drops)

⸻

🧵 6. What Your Recent Performances Tell Me

**A. You're developing real athletic capacity**

Your October and November workouts show:
• Strong HR control
• High top-end output
• Increasing squat strength
• Rapid posterior-chain adaptation
• Better form on pulls and hinges

**B. Your CNS is the limiting factor, not your muscles**

Your strain numbers are high, your recovery drops, and you mentally feel more beat when you go beyond ~14 strain.

**C. You have elite "bounce back" capacity**

Whenever you take 1 recovery day:
• Your HRV improves
• Your energy skyrockets
• Your next workout is a jump in performance

**D. You're built for hybrid training**

Your data consistently shows you thrive in:

**"Strength + short bursts + controlled cardio."**

This is exactly the profile of someone who can nail:
• HYROX
• Ski conditioning
• Tactical fitness
• Spartan prep
• Aesthetics-focused hypertrophy

**E. Your body composition trend is textbook**

Based on the progression in the DEXA:
• Fat: 43.4 → 36.9 lbs
• Lean: 119.5 → 120.5 lbs

This means during fat loss, you've preserved or added muscle, which is extremely rare at your stage.

🏆 7. Final Identity Summary (How an LLM coach should "think of you")

You are a **hybrid athlete in development**, with:
• High drive
• High intelligence about your body
• Strong posterior chain
• Improving squat/hinge power
• A cardio engine that allows both Zone 2 and HIIT
• A CNS that needs more consistent recovery planning

**Your best training formula:**

**Heavy → Explosive → Pump → Zone 2**

**And your psychological motivators:**
• Progress
• Pump
• Structure
• Athleticism
• PRs
• Feeling "capable" in your body

🎯 Design Principles for Workout Generation

**Must Incorporate:**
1. Heavy compounds with visible progression tracking (PRs, weight increases)
2. Pump-focused accessory blocks (especially arms, back, chest)
3. Explosive work in conditioning days (jumps, power movements)
4. Clear structure: Warm-up → Block A (heavy) → Block B (pump/accessories) → Finisher
5. Lateral/ski-prep elements in lower body days
6. 2–3 heavy sets at RPE 7–8, then higher-rep accessory
7. Core finishers you love (deadbugs, planks, knee tucks)

**Must Avoid:**
1. Exercises that irritate wrist (pushups, dips, front rack)
2. Poor burpee form (lower back irritation risk)
3. Filler exercises or generic movements
4. Workouts that feel too light
5. Volume creep beyond planned structure
6. CNS-overloading sequences (keep strain 12–14 for sustainable days)

**Must Design Around:**
1. Wrist limitation → prefer neutral grips, DB over barbell where needed
2. Lower back sensitivity → cue proper burpee form, consider alternatives
3. CNS recovery → don't stack >2 high-strain days, include reset days
4. Volume creep tendency → set clear exercise limits per block
