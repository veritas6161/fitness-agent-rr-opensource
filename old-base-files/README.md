# Old/Base Files - Previous Iteration

This directory contains files from the previous iteration of the Fitness Agent system. These files serve as reference/base materials and will be updated step by step as we build the new system.

## Usage Notes

**Important:** These files are NOT to be used directly in the new code yet. They are:
- Reference materials for understanding the previous system
- Base templates that will be updated as we iterate
- Will be replaced/updated step by step during the build process

## Status

- ✅ Files copied to old-base-files/ directory
- ⏳ Files remain in root directory for now (will reference from there during build)
- ⏳ New updated versions will be created in fitness-agent/ or appropriate locations
