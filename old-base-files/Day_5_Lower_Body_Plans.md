🦵 Day 5 — Lower Body Strength (Glutes, Hams, Deadlifts)

**Target:** 7–8 exercises | **HR Target:** >135 | **Session Length:** 50–55 min | **Strain Target:** 12–14

This is your heavy day. Deadlifts are mandatory here. Lower body strength is trending upward fast — your squat PR (155 lbs) is aligned with your current lean mass. Focus on posterior chain work, ski prep, and visible progression.

⸻

📋 Day Overview

**Structure:** Warm-up → Block A (Heavy Lifts — Mandatory) → Block B (Glute/Ham Work) → Block C (Ski Conditioning Add-ons)

**Formula:** Heavy → Glute/Ham → Ski Prep

**Key Focus:**
• Deadlifts mandatory (RDL or conventional)
• Squat variation (you respond well to these)
• Posterior chain work (you respond exceptionally well)
• Ski prep elements (lateral, balance, stability)
• Heavy sets at RPE 7–8 → higher-rep accessory

🛡️ Guardrails

**Must Follow:**
1. **Deadlifts are MANDATORY** — Must appear in Block A every Day 5
2. **Squat variation is MANDATORY** — Must appear in Block A every Day 5
3. **Complete each block in one location** before moving to next block
4. **Total exercises:** 7–8 (do not exceed — prevents volume creep)
5. **Heavy lifts first** — Block A before accessories (large muscles first)
6. **HR >135** — Maintain pace with appropriate rest (120 sec for heavy, 60–75 sec for accessories)
7. **Posterior chain focus** — You respond exceptionally well to this

**Progression Rules:**
• **Deadlifts:** Increase 5–10 lbs every 1–2 weeks (track this carefully)
• **Squats:** Progress toward PR of 155 lbs total — track weekly
• **Eccentric tempo:** 3 seconds for hypertrophy focus
• **Volume:** Add 1 rep per set OR add 2.5–5 lbs when sets feel easy

**Volume Management:**
• Feeling great? Add 1 optional exercise in Block C
• CNS fatigued? Drop 1 exercise from Block B or C, keep heavy sets
• Sleep <6h20m? Use Version B (machines, less CNS load) or reduce heavy sets to 2

**Equipment Alternatives:**
• If barbell unavailable → Use DB RDL and goblet squat or leg press
• If leg press unavailable → Use goblet squat or hack squat
• If hamstring curl unavailable → Use single leg RDL or glute bridge

**Ski Prep Focus:**
• Block C should include lateral work, balance, stability
• Copenhagen adductor is excellent for lateral stability
• BOSU balance work is ski-specific
• Single leg work in Block B supports ski prep

💡 Pro Tips

**Execution:**
1. **Warm-up sets:** 2–3 light warm-up sets for deadlifts and squats (not full warm-up, just working weight prep)
2. **Heavy sets (RPE 7–8):** Should feel challenging but 2–3 reps left — not failure
3. **Deadlift form:** Focus on hip hinge, keep back neutral, control eccentric (3 sec)
4. **Squat form:** Depth matters, drive through heels, keep core braced

**Progression:**
1. **Week 1–2:** Establish baseline weights and form
2. **Week 3–4:** Add 5–10 lbs to deadlifts OR add 2.5–5 lbs to squats
3. **Week 5–6:** Progress to next weight increment OR add optional exercise if energy allows
4. **PR tracking:** Track deadlift PR, squat PR (targeting 155 lbs total), leg press PR

**Posterior Chain Focus:**
• You respond exceptionally well to posterior chain work — prioritize this
• RDLs, pulls, glutes should be staples
• Single leg RDL is excellent for balance + posterior chain

**Recovery Cues:**
• If Whoop strain >14 → Next Day 5, use Version B (machines, less CNS) or reduce heavy sets to 2
• If CNS fatigued → Keep heavy sets, drop 1 exercise from Block B or C
• If lower back tight → Focus on RDL form, reduce load slightly, add extra rest between heavy sets

**Ski Prep Integration:**
• Block C is specifically for ski conditioning — don't skip this
• Lateral work (Copenhagen, side lunges) is critical
• Balance work (BOSU, single leg holds) supports ski performance
• Unilateral work in Block B also supports ski prep

**Psychological Motivators:**
• **Progress:** Track deadlift and squat PRs — visible progression you love
• **Posterior chain:** You respond well to this — lean into it
• **Ski prep:** Athletic feel, not just gym work — Block C keeps it athletic
