🏋️‍♂️ Reza's Workout Script Knowledge Base (KB)

This KB defines the repeatable weekly workout system, exercise templates, options, constraints, and progression rules. It is designed for 6 training days/week, 50–55 min/session, HR >135, 6–9 exercises/day for strength days (no strict limit for conditioning/EMOM days), and low cognitive load with high output.

3. If CNS fatigued → drop 1 exercise, keep volume moderate
4. Deadlifts → increase 5–10 lbs every 1–2 weeks
5. Keep eccentric tempo 3 seconds for hypertrophy

⸻

🧠 Notes & Options
	•	Wrist injury → avoid front rack; prefer neutral grips.
	•	No landmine movements used anywhere.
	•	All templates are scalable and interchangeable.
	•	Day 6 alternates between Script A and Script B depending on energy.
