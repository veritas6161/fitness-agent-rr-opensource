💪 Day 4 — Upper Body Strength (Push + Pull + Arms)

**Target:** 9–11 exercises | **HR Target:** >135 | **Session Length:** 55–60 min | **Strain Target:** 12–14

This day focuses on upper body pump sessions that leave you energized, not drained. Heavy compounds with visible progression → pump accessories → core finisher. Arms appear twice this week (also on Day 6).

🛡️ Guardrails

**Must Follow:**
1. **Hit every big muscle group twice per week** — This is one of two upper body days
2. **Large muscles first, smaller muscles later** — Push/Pull before Arms
3. **Compound movements before isolation** — Chest press before tricep isolation
4. **Complete each block in one location** before moving to next block
5. **Total exercises:** 8–9 (do not exceed — prevents volume creep)
6. **Arms appear twice per week** — This is first arm day (also on Day 6)
7. **HR >135** — Maintain pace with 45–60 sec rest, shorter if needed

**Exercise Substitutions (Wrist Safety):**
• If bench press irritates wrist → Use DB bench press or machine chest press
• If pushups appear → Substitute with chest press or DB fly
• Avoid dips completely (wrist limitation)
• Prefer neutral grips (DB shoulder press, hammer curls)

**Volume Management:**
• Feeling great? Add 1 optional exercise in Block C
• CNS fatigued? Drop 1 exercise, keep heavy sets focused
• Sleep <6h20m? Use Version A (machines, less CNS load) or drop 1 optional exercise

**Equipment Alternatives:**
• If machine unavailable → Use barbell or dumbbell equivalent
• If cable unavailable → Use dumbbell or machine equivalent
• Always have 2–3 equipment options per movement pattern

💡 Pro Tips

**Execution:**
1. **Warm-up sets matter:** 1–2 light warm-up sets before heavy work (not full warm-up)
2. **Heavy sets (RPE 7–8):** Should feel challenging but 2–3 reps left in tank
3. **Pump sets (12–15 reps):** Focus on squeeze and contraction, not just moving weight
4. **Rest periods:** Heavy work = 90 sec, pump work = 60 sec — adjust to maintain HR >135

**Progression:**
1. **Week 1–2:** Establish baseline weights and reps
2. **Week 3–4:** Add 2.5–5 lbs to heavy compounds OR add 1 rep per set
3. **Week 5–6:** Progress to next weight increment OR add optional exercise if energy allows
4. **PR tracking:** Track chest press, lat pulldown, shoulder press PRs — visible progression you love

**Pump Focus:**
• **Face pulls:** YOU LOVE THIS — make it count, focus on rear delt squeeze
• **Curls:** Full ROM, squeeze at top, controlled negative — bicep pump is a motivator
• **DB shoulder press:** YOU LOVE THIS — neutral grip protects wrist, focus on shoulder pump

**Recovery Cues:**
• If Whoop strain >14 → Next Day 4, use Version A (machines, less CNS) or drop 1 optional exercise
• If wrist irritated → Substitute all barbell work with DB or machine alternatives
• If CNS fatigued → Keep heavy sets, skip optional exercises

**Psychological Motivators:**
• **Progress:** Track weights, aim for PRs every 2–3 weeks
• **Pump:** Focus on exercises you love (face pulls, curls, DB shoulder press)
• **Structure:** Clear blocks — heavy → pump — no filler
• **Energy:** Upper body pump sessions should leave you energized, not drained
