🎯 Reza's Fitness Goals & Agent Objectives

This document defines current status, short-term goals, long-term targets, event preparation requirements, and system preferences for autopilot workout management.

⸻

📊 Current Status

**Body Composition:**
• Current body fat: 20%
• Target body fat by end of January: 17%
• Long-term body fat range: 13–17% (year-round maintenance)
  - Maximum: 17% (upper limit)
  - Ideal range: 13–17%
  - Bulking seasons: Considered if needed, but maintain awareness of upper limit

**Context:**
• See health progression data (to be uploaded separately) for detailed metrics
• Workout structure: See `Reza_Workout_Script_KB.md` for weekly system and exercise templates

⸻

🎯 Primary Goals

**Body Composition:**
1. Reduce body fat from 20% → 17% by end of January
2. Develop more muscle mass
3. Achieve visible abs by end of next year
4. Maintain body fat between 13–17% year-round

**Athletic Development:**
5. Become more athletic (power, agility, endurance)
6. Prepare for competitive events in the coming year

⸻

🏁 Event Preparation Goals (2025)

**Target Events:**
1. Hyrox, Spartan, or Tactical Fitness race (1–2 events)
2. Half Iron Man (at least 1 event)

**Event Timeline:**
• Events planned for next year (2025)
• Prepare for 1–2 competitive events total

**Specific Requirements:**
• Endurance capacity for Half Iron Man distances
• Functional strength and conditioning for Hyrox/Spartan/Tactical Fitness
• Power output and metabolic conditioning
• Injury resilience and movement quality

⸻

⛷️ Seasonal Preparation

**Ski Season (Winter):**
• Active skiing during winter months
• Training must include ski-specific preparation
• Maintain overall fitness while prioritizing ski performance
• Balance event prep with ski conditioning

**Ski-Specific Training Focus:**
• Lower body strength (quads, glutes, hamstrings)
• Lateral stability and balance (Day 5 already includes BOSU, lateral hops, Copenhagen plank)
• Core strength for stability
• Eccentric control and power

⸻

🤖 Agent Objectives & System Preferences

**Mode: Autopilot / Low Cognitive Load**
• Primary objective: Remove decision fatigue from workout planning
• Use pre-managed, structured workout scripts
• Agent should generate specific exercise lists, sets, reps, and weights
• Minimize daily planning overhead
• Maximize consistency and adherence

**Script-Based Approach:**
• Workouts follow weekly structure defined in KB (6 days/week)
• Exercise selection from templates in KB
• Progression rules applied automatically
• Exercise Library referenced for specific movements

**Decision Support:**
• Agent should adjust based on:
  - HR targets (maintain >135)
  - Energy levels
  - Recovery status
  - Progression milestones
  - Body fat trajectory (toward 17% goal)

⸻

📈 Goal Prioritization & Timeline

**Phase 1: Immediate (Current → End of January)**
• Priority: Body fat reduction (20% → 17%)
• Maintain muscle mass during cut
• Continue ski preparation (winter active)
• Adhere to 6-day/week structure

**Phase 2: Event Preparation (Throughout 2025)**
• Build toward Half Iron Man capacity
• Develop race-specific fitness (Hyrox/Spartan/Tactical Fitness)
• Continue body fat management (13–17% range)
• Muscle development and athletic performance

**Phase 3: Long-Term Maintenance (End of 2025+)**
• Visible abs achieved
• Body fat maintained 13–17% year-round
• Event readiness maintained
• Sustainable autopilot system

🔗 Integration Points

**References:**
• Weekly structure: `Reza_Workout_Script_KB.md`
• Exercise templates: `Reza_Workout_Script_KB.md` (Day 1–7 breakdowns)
• Exercise library: `Exercise_Library.csv` (for specific exercise selection)
• Health progression: (to be uploaded separately)

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Read weekly structure from KB
2. Select exercises from templates based on day
3. Reference Exercise Library for movement details
4. Generate sets, reps, and weights
5. Adjust based on progression rules and goal trajectory
6. Consider seasonal priorities (ski prep during winter)
7. Track body fat progress toward 17% goal

⸻

⚙️ Constraints & Considerations

**Injury Management:**
• Wrist injury → avoid front rack; prefer neutral grips
• No landmine movements

**Training Frequency:**
• 6 training days/week
• 50–55 min/session
• HR >135 maintained during sessions

**Goal Conflicts & Balance:**
• Body fat reduction vs. muscle building (prioritize recomp during cut to 17%)
• Ski prep vs. event prep (integrate both, prioritize based on season)
• Endurance (Half Iron Man) vs. power (Hyrox/Spartan) (periodize or blend)

⸻

✅ Success Metrics

**By End of January:**
• Body fat: ≤17% (from 20%)

**By End of 2025:**
• Visible abs achieved
• Body fat maintained: 13–17%
• Completed 1–2 competitive events (Hyrox/Spartan/Tactical Fitness and/or Half Iron Man)
• Increased muscle mass and athletic performance
• Autopilot system functioning smoothly

**Ongoing:**
• Consistent adherence to 6-day/week schedule
• HR targets met (daily >135)
• Progressive overload maintained
• Injury-free training
• Ski performance maintained during winter

📝 Notes

• Health progression data will provide detailed metrics for tracking
• Agent should reference this document when generating workouts
• Goals may be adjusted based on progress and feedback
• Maintain flexibility for seasonal priorities (ski season)
