# Preferences & Constraints

## What Excites Me
- Heavy compounds with visible progression (PRs, weight increases)
- Sessions that create a pump (biceps, back, push days)
- Explosive work (box jumps, skater hops, power movements)
- Structured HIIT with challenge arc (EMOMs, HYROX-style)
- Lateral/ski-prep work (feeling athletic)
- Clear structure: Warm-up → Block A (heavy) → Block B (pump) → Finisher

## Exercises I Love
- Face pulls, curls, DB shoulder press
- Renegade rows, machine chest fly
- Leg press, lunges, split squats
- Core finishers: deadbugs, planks, knee tucks
- Heavy squats, deadlifts, RDLs, lat pulldowns

## Exercises I Dislike
- Dips (wrist issue)
- Push-ups (wrist issue)
- HIIT-only with no lifting
- Generic filler exercises
- Workouts that feel too light

## Injury History & Constraints

### Right Wrist — ACTIVE ISSUE
- **Issue:** Tendon problems (not fracture)
- **History:** X-ray Feb 2025 after ski fall showed no fracture, but tendon flares with loading
- **Triggers:** Backward movements, heavy loading, front rack position
- **Management:** Avoid dips, push-ups, front rack. Use neutral grips, DBs over barbell when needed

### Left Knee — RESOLVED
- **Issue:** ACL reconstruction (previous ski injury, full tear)
- **Status:** Full rehab complete, leg is good now
- **Management:** No restrictions, continue normal training

### Right Knee — WATCH
- **Issue:** Outer patella area pain with overuse
- **Triggers:** Running, jumping, likely form-related
- **Management:** Monitor during plyometrics, address form issues

### Lower Back — DEVELOPING
- **Issue:** Gets tight with burpees and deadlifts
- **Status:** No injury, muscles still developing
- **Management:** Proper form on hinges, don't overload, be careful around this muscle group

### CNS Recovery
- Don't stack >2 high-strain days consecutively
- Include reset/recovery days
- Watch for volume creep

## Best Training Formula
**Heavy → Explosive → Pump → Zone 2**

## Session Preferences
- 2-3 heavy sets at RPE 7-8, then higher-rep accessory
- Cardio after lifting, never before
- Zone 2 on incline treadmill
- Conditioning days = explosive + structured
