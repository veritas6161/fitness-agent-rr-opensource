## Workout Design Rules

**Core Rule:** One block = one location. Complete all exercises in a block before moving floors.

**Block Flow Example:**
- Block A → Floor 2 (heavy compounds)
- Block B → Floor 1 Machine Side (accessories)
- Block C → Floor 3 (conditioning finisher)

**Sequencing:**
1. Large muscles before small muscles
2. Compound before isolation
3. Heavy before pump
4. Minimize floor changes within blocks
5. Keep HR >135 during transitions (45-60s rest)
