## Workout Design Rules

**Core Rule:** [Your main rule, e.g., "One block = one location. Complete all exercises in a block before moving floors."]

**Block Flow Example:**
- Block A → [Floor/Location] ([purpose])
- Block B → [Floor/Location] ([purpose])
- Block C → [Floor/Location] ([purpose])

**Sequencing:**
1. [Rule 1, e.g., "Large muscles before small muscles"]
2. [Rule 2, e.g., "Compound before isolation"]
3. [Rule 3, e.g., "Heavy before pump"]
4. [Rule 4, e.g., "Minimize floor changes within blocks"]
5. [Rule 5, e.g., "Keep HR >[X] during transitions ([X]s rest)"]
